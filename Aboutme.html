      Hi! My name is Will and I'm from the sunny English Lake district. I study
      industrial product design at Northumbria Univeristy in Newcastle. I'm an
      outgoing person who spends most my time with friends doing anything and
      everything. My hobbies include surfing, climbing, gaming and camping to
      name a few.
