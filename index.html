        <h2>Why NMD?</h2>
        <p>
          I am not actually an NMD student. I am an exchange student from the Uk
          and I study Design for Industry at Northumbria University in
          Newcastle. My course takes us in all directions of design allowing us
          to not only work on traditional product design, but to also work in
          graphic and physical design which is why I am here to improve my
          graphic and computer science skills further.

        <h2>How long am I here?</h2>
        <p>
          I sadly leave just before Christmas to return to my UK based studies
          in the New Year. I might have to smuggle myself back into Sweden to
          see all of the friends I have made, if Brexit doesn't make it even
          harder to return.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Sweden?</h2>
        <p>
          I love the Scandinavian nature and always planned to visit Sweden.
          Also after finding out about kick off I really wanted to be involved
          and make the most of my life in a post-COVID world. It was everything
          that I hoped it would be, but I am still angry. HINT should have one
          class of the year, maybe I return for a masters just to claim the
          title...
